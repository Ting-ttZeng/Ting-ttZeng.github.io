Our work quantitatively evaluated the impact of community dynamics on the distribution of 3-hydroxy fatty acids in soil and the pH proxies. Taking bacterial community into consideration is really important❗️❗️

**Adaptation of membrane lipids in Gram-negative bacteria to soil pH.**
**Establishment of novel temperature and pH proxies based on 3-OH-FAs using machine learning.**
