**Completed projects**<br>
- The influence of Gram-negative bacterial community on the distribution of 3-OH-FAs in soils
<div><img src="/images/pro/qu.jpg"></div>
Our work quantitatively evaluated the impact of community dynamics on the distribution of 3-hydroxy fatty acids in soil and the pH proxies. Taking bacterial community into consideration is really important!<br>
<br>

# **Ongoing projects**<br>
- Adaptation of membrane lipids in Gram-negative bacteria to soil pH.
- Establishment of novel temperature and pH proxies based on 3-OH-FAs using machine learning.
